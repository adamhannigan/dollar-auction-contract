# Dollar Auction

This repo contains the smart contract that is powering the Dollar Auction NFT.

It extends the functionality of Open Zepellin ERC721 and adds extra behaviour.

# What is a Dollar Auction

A dollar auction was an experiment designed by Martin Shubik to illustrate a non-zero sum game.

Ownership of the original Dollar NFT is granted to whoever the highest bidder is.

At any time another person can outbid you and claim ownership of the NFT.

Once you become the third highest bidder, your bid is automatically returned along with 5% royalties & you have the ability to mint your bid as an NFT.
